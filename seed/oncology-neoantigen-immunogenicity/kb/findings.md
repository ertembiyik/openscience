# Validated Findings

Structured record of what we have confirmed through our work.
Each finding has a confidence level, source, and implications.

**Format**: Entries are appended by agents using the `lab_append_finding` tool.
Do NOT manually edit existing entries. To correct a finding, the reviewer
adds a note and may downgrade confidence.

**Confidence levels**:
- **HIGH**: Reproduced or independently verified
- **MEDIUM**: Strong evidence, not yet reproduced
- **LOW**: Preliminary, needs verification
