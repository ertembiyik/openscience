# Progress Report: 2026-02-08

## Summary
Synthesized 4 global cancer treatment breakthrough tracks and identified neoantigen immunogenicity prediction as the highest-leverage computational contribution we can make.

## What Was Done

### Research Synthesis
Investigated 4 major cancer treatment breakthroughs happening globally:

1. **mRNA Cancer Vaccines (Europe-wide)** -- Moderna/Merck and BioNTech running Phase II/III trials. Moderna's melanoma vaccine showed 49% reduction in recurrence at 5 years. Identified as **highest computational leverage**.

2. **Cancer Cell Reprogramming (South Korea, KAIST)** -- Prof. Cho's lab published 4+ major papers in 12 months on reprogramming cancer cells back to normal using Boolean network models. Promising but 5-15 years from clinical impact.

3. **CAR-T Solid Tumors (Spain, expanding)** -- 50%+ remission rates for blood cancers, now trying to crack solid tumors. 12 Phase I studies presented at ASCO 2025.

4. **Autologous Vaccines & Early Detection (Russia)** -- Petrov Center and Gamaleya Center. Some aggressive efficacy claims need independent verification.

### Key Decision
Selected **Track 1: mRNA Cancer Vaccine Neoantigen Prediction** as primary focus because:
- The computational bottleneck is clearly defined (immunogenicity prediction is poorly solved)
- Open-source tools exist to build on (9 tools cataloged)
- Public datasets available (IEDB, TESLA, TCGA)
- Multiple clinical trials running NOW that need better algorithms
- Better prediction = directly more patients respond to treatment
- Can be done entirely computationally

### Tools & Datasets Cataloged
- **Tools**: ImmunoNX, OpenVax, pVACtools, NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, DeepNeo, nextNEOpi, Seq2Neo, NeoDisc
- **Datasets**: TCGA (20,000+ tumor samples), IEDB (immune epitope database), TESLA Consortium benchmarks, GEO, Human Protein Atlas

### European Trials Research
Compiled comprehensive brief on European mRNA cancer vaccine trials: BioNTech, Moderna, CureVac programs across melanoma, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, and other cancers. Mapped computational opportunities in neoantigen prediction, mRNA sequence optimization, patient stratification.

## Session 2: Broad Research Expansion

### What Was Done

Expanded research scope dramatically. Ran 4 parallel deep-dive research agents across the entire computational oncology landscape to identify every area where a SWE + AI team can contribute.

### 6 Shots on Goal Identified

After synthesizing findings across AI drug discovery, early detection, imaging, multi-omics, immunotherapy, cancer reprogramming, synthetic biology, and antibody design, we identified **6 independent shots on goal**:

| Priority | Shot | Key Insight |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **P0** | Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction | NeoTImmuML (AUC 0.8865) is new SOTA. Key gap: no tool integrates ALL signals. Boltz-2 structural features are largely missing. |
| **P1** | Drug combination prediction | PANC1 pipeline achieved 83% hit rate. Fully open-source. Immediately extensible to other cancers. |
| **P2** | Cancer cell reprogramming | CANDiT (UCSD, Cell Reports Medicine Oct 2025) made cancer stem cells self-destruct. Complementary to KAIST's BENEIN. |
| **P2** | Liquid biopsy ML | FinaleToolkit + DELFI provide feature extraction. Downstream ML classifiers are where innovation happens. Stage I detection still hard. |
| **P3** | Digital pathology AI | UNI 2.0 (200M+ images) is open-source. Fine-tuning = engineering challenge, not biology. 30K free TCGA slides. |
| **P3** | AI antibody design | RFantibody (Baker Lab, Nature Nov 2025) designs antibodies from scratch. MIT license. Could target our predicted neoantigens. |

### Major New Tools Discovered

- **NeoTImmuML**: Best open immunogenicity predictor (AUC 0.8865), with TumorAgDB2.0 database
- **Boltz-2**: Protein structure + binding prediction, MIT license, 20 sec/prediction, 1000x faster than physics methods
- **PANC1**: Drug synergy prediction, 83% hit rate, fully open on GitHub
- **C2S-Scale 27B**: Google DeepMind/Yale single-cell foundation model, found new cancer immunotherapy pathways
- **CellFM**: 800M parameter single-cell model (100M cells), outperforms scGPT
- **RFantibody**: De novo antibody design with atomic accuracy, open-source
- **CANDiT**: ML cancer reprogramming framework, cancer stem cells self-destruct
- **UNI 2.0**: Pathology foundation model, SOTA, open-source
- **Pillar-0**: Radiology foundation model, 0.87 AUC on 350+ conditions, open-source
- **SENTI-202**: Logic-gated CAR-NK therapy, 71% response rate in AML, in Phase 1 trials

### Files Created
- `research/01-ai-drug-discovery-and-foundation-models.md`
- `research/02-early-detection-imaging-multiomics.md`
- `research/03-immunotherapy-reprogramming-synbio.md`
- `research/04-shots-on-goal.md` (the key strategic document)

### CLAUDE.md Updated
- Added all 6 shots on goal with tools, data sources, and cross-cutting synergies
- Added research documents index
- Updated next steps checklist

## Next Steps
- Set up bioinformatics toolchain (Python, BioPython, PyTorch)
- Download and explore IEDB and TESLA benchmark datasets
- Reproduce NeoTImmuML baseline results
- Reproduce PANC1 drug combination pipeline
- Begin error analysis on where current neoantigen prediction approaches fail
- Design improved immunogenicity predictor integrating structural features via Boltz-2
