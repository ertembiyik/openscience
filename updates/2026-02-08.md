## Summary
Synthesized 4 global cancer treatment breakthrough tracks and identified neoantigen immunogenicity prediction as the highest-leverage computational contribution we can make.

## What Was Done

### Research Synthesis
Investigated 4 major cancer treatment breakthroughs happening globally:

1. **mRNA Cancer Vaccines (Europe-wide)** -- Moderna/Merck and BioNTech running Phase II/III trials. Moderna's melanoma vaccine showed 49% reduction in recurrence at 5 years. Identified as **highest computational leverage**.

2. **Cancer Cell Reprogramming (South Korea, KAIST)** -- Prof. Cho's lab published 4+ major papers in 12 months on reprogramming cancer cells back to normal using Boolean network models. Promising but 5-15 years from clinical impact.

3. **CAR-T Solid Tumors (Spain, expanding)** -- 50%+ remission rates for blood cancers, now trying to crack solid tumors. 12 Phase I studies presented at ASCO 2025.

4. **Autologous Vaccines & Early Detection (Russia)** -- Petrov Center and Gamaleya Center. Some aggressive efficacy claims need independent verification.

### Key Decision
Selected **Track 1: mRNA Cancer Vaccine Neoantigen Prediction** as primary focus because:
- The computational bottleneck is clearly defined (immunogenicity prediction is poorly solved)
- Open-source tools exist to build on (9 tools cataloged)
- Public datasets available (IEDB, TESLA, TCGA)
- Multiple clinical trials running NOW that need better algorithms
- Better prediction = directly more patients respond to treatment
- Can be done entirely computationally

### Tools & Datasets Cataloged
- **Tools**: ImmunoNX, OpenVax, pVACtools, NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, DeepNeo, nextNEOpi, Seq2Neo, NeoDisc
- **Datasets**: TCGA (20,000+ tumor samples), IEDB (immune epitope database), TESLA Consortium benchmarks, GEO, Human Protein Atlas

### European Trials Research
Compiled comprehensive brief on European mRNA cancer vaccine trials: BioNTech, Moderna, CureVac programs across melanoma, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, and other cancers. Mapped computational opportunities in neoantigen prediction, mRNA sequence optimization, patient stratification.
